## File:    LocalSourceDoxyfile.in
## Purpose: Doxygen configuration template for documentation from MRB sources
## Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@fnal.gov)
## Date:    August 22, 2016
##
## This template is tailored to generate documentation for the source code
## currently in the working area being compiled. It does not descend into any
## package that is not in the MRB source area, including other LArSoft packages.
## 
## See SourceDoxyfile.in for a bit more information.
##

# this is the basic configuration:
@INCLUDE = SourceDoxyfile

## This input path would add all all the source in the MRB source ares
INPUT                  = $(MRB_SOURCE)/
